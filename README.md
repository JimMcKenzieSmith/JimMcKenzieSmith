## Hi, I'm Jim ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a Staff Software Engineer working at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in the modern data stack (Fivetran, Snowflake, dbt, SQL, Python, and AWS). In April 2021, I was brought on to lead the development in migrating the company from their legacy PostgreSQL "colo" reporting database to a modern Snowflake data pipeline and data warehouse. My team is also building out Next.js web apps that hook directly into Snowflake for reporting. The project has been, and continues to be, an incredible success.

ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning:**
 - I just recently attended [Coalesce 2023](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/), and had a lot of great takeaways. Ask me about it!
 - Snowflake and dbt are areas where I'm continuing to dive deep.  I recently received certifications in both.  
 - In my career I've mainly been a Java developer, with some occassional JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, and Scala mixed in.  To challege myself and to enhance my Python skills, I'm currently tackling the [LeetCode medium's](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-medium/) using Python.

âš¡ **Fun facts about me:**
 - I live out in the country, on 4 acres, with my wife and three kids.
 - My family and I have chickens, goats, dogs, and cats.
